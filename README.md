I needed a JSON parser for a project of mine in which I attempt to do as much as possible myself.
This attempts to be very, very small and provide only the bare minimum. Have a look at [test.cpp](./test.cpp) to see how to use it.
I was actually surprised how little code you need to write a functional JSON parser that provides a very reasonable interface too.
